<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. -->
<!-- You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which -->
<!-- launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. -->

<!-- To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the -->
<!-- convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front -->
<!-- matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it -->
<!-- works. -->

<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: -->

<!-- {% highlight ruby %} -->
<!-- def print_hi(name) -->
<!--   puts "Hi, #{name}" -->
<!-- end -->
<!-- print_hi('Tom') -->
<!-- #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. -->
<!-- {% endhighlight %} -->

<!-- Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most -->
<!-- out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub -->
<!-- repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll -->
<!-- Talk][jekyll-talk]. -->
